## Digital footprints

One perspective: data that is created as a **by-product** of people's interactions with digital systems

<br>

. . . 

A misleading definition? When you post a comment on social media, it's an expression of deliberate action. The post is created intentionally and surely it counts as digital data.

. . .

And *other metadata* is generated in connection with your post - users will differ in the extent of their awareness.

## Digital data

- Social life is now digitally mediated
  - Examples: Netflix/YouTube watch histories
  - Terms you will hear: *digital exhaust or passive data; digital footprints/breadcrumbs*
  - Main attribute: it is generated organically as users interact with digital technologies
- Storage of records
  - Consider digitized attendance sheets
  - Are they different from data produced by sensors?


## Classic examples 

- Web browsing & web searches
- Social media use 
- Mobile phone use
- Steps tracking
- Comments on blogs and internet fora
- Online purchases


## Storing and digitizing

- Payments in a store with a credit card
- Historical texts/archives and audio-visual data which have been digitized

### And also:

- Surveys you fill online
- You decision to report content on TikTok as offensive or inappropriate

##

## {background-color="black" background-image="img/midjourney/m4b.png" background-opacity=.5} 

### Stylized examples 

Web browsing & web searches, social media use, mobile phone use, fitness tracking...

#### But remember

- There are still time use surveys ([AHTUS](https://www.ahtusdata.org/ahtus/))
- Gfk MRI asks respondents: "Did you watch movie X in the last 6 months?"
   - Netfilx knows for sure
   - Or does it?
- Inflation tracking involves visits to retail to stores

## Characteristics

- Data is (potentially) continuously collected
- Typically unobtrusive
  - Potentially providing a **more authentic snapshot** of behavior, preferences
  - "Non-reactive" aspect emphasizes these is no visible prompting from researchers
- Collection of data may be concealed
  - We will talk about surveillance and ethics
- Often augmented with metadata (location at the time of measurement; social relationships; etc.)

## {background-color="black" background-image="img/garminapp.png" background-opacity=.5} 

- You will often hear that digital data is "unstructured"
- Yes, but many apps provide commercial solutions / dashboards

## Dynamic responses

- One issue we'll come back to: do we think wearing a smartwatch leads to changes behaviors? 
  - If you forget your watch at a friend's place, will you go for a run anyway? 
  - This is not just a "data incompleteness" issue
- Distinct issues
  - The Hawthorne Effect: a psychological phenomenon where individuals modify (or improve) their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed
  - Selection bias

## Applications across fields {.smaller}

### Social science

- Twitter has been used to study how (mis)information spreads; great interest in network structures 
- Many attempts to measure public opinion in real time 

### Public health

- Time spent away from home, time spent at workplaces, etc. ([Google Mobility reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/))

### Business

- Foot Traffic Data ([Safegraph](https://www.safegraph.com/guides/foot-traffic-data))

# Concrete examples

## Social relationships {.smaller}

Facebook Social Connectedness Index 

The Social Connectedness Index (SCI) is a measure of the social connectedness between different geographies. Specifically, expressing the relative probability that two individuals across two locations are friends with each other on Facebook.

## Public health {.smaller}

> Lodi is an Italian province of around 230,000 inhabitants in the heavily impacted region of Lombardy. It contains Codogno, where the earliest cases of COVID-19 in Italy were detected, and was at the center of Italy’s outbreak

## Psychology {.smaller}

- Goal: understand how national emotions changed after a tragic event
- Ask yourself: what would the ideal dataset contain? 

. . .

Garcia and Rime. 2019. Collective Emotions and Social Resilience in the Digital Traces After a Terrorist Attack

- After November 13, 2015, the authors collected tweets with hashtags related to the terrorist attacks in Paris.
- Applied language detection to each tweet in combination with language metadata provided by Twitter (keeping only tweets in French)
- One (bad) option: hashtag tweets as a corpus. Instead: identify a panel of user accounts
- Of the users found in the initial data set 287K (58%) shared location information in their profile
-  62,114 user accounts in France

# Drawbacks

## Weaknesses of Digital Trace Data

- Illusion of completeness (suppose your study participants agree to install a web tracker)
- Often inaccessible
  - Or sudden loss of access
- As monitoring improve, the incentive to manipulate signals increases
- Normalizing constant data collection

::: aside
"Campaigns and companies, aware that news media are monitoring Twitter, have used numerous tactics to make sure their candidate or product is trending" ([Lazer et al. 2014](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/0314policyforumff.pdf))

There seem to be unprecedented scientific possibilities thanks to new data collection methods, but...

> "Big data hubris" is the often implicit assumption that big data are a substitute for, rather than a supplement to, traditional data collection and analysis

> **Algorithm dynamics** are the changes made by engineers to improve the commercial service and by consum- ers in using that service. Several changes in Google’s search algorithm and user behav- ior likely affected GFT’s tracking.

> There are multiple challenges to replicating GFT’s original algorithm. GFT has never documented the 45 search terms used, and the examples that have been released appear misleading.
